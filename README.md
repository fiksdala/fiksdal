This was my first attempt at writing an R package back in ~2018. It essentially packaged a bunch of old helper functions I had written previously to support my grad school work. I was still in the early stages of learning R when most of this code was written (maybe 2014? I don't really remember). As a result, most of this code is pretty ugly and documentation may be incomplete. I'm archiving it now because my skills have progressed far beyond what they were when this was written and I have no need for it anymore. Still, it's interesting to revisit occasionally to see how my coding style has changed and my skills have improved. I also want the code accessible in the unlikely event I'd need to re-run super old code from grad school that uses this package for some reason.
